# Thoughts after day - 7th January (Written on 14th January)

This journal entry reflects on the events of 7th January. Due to being extremely busy working on my model, I couldn't write my journal daily. Instead, I noted down key bullet points to document what happened.  

Rather than a traditional journal entry, this serves as a detailed log of the day’s events and my thoughts.

## Thoughts and Observations
1. **Model Accuracy Challenges**  
   - It was disappointing to see the model's accuracy drop below the previous model's performance.  
   - Despite applying data augmentation, it didn’t improve accuracy for this particular dataset.  
   - Repeated attempts with data augmentation in future models yielded similar results, consistently decreasing accuracy.

2. **Exploring New Approaches**  
   - I need to try a different strategy to enhance the model’s accuracy.  
   - One potential solution is to use **pretrained models**.  
   - While I’ve heard about pretrained models, I haven’t learned how to implement them yet.  
   - My next step is to study pretrained models and apply them in my work.

## Action Plan
- Research and understand the concept and implementation of pretrained models.  
- Experiment with pretrained models to achieve higher accuracy.  
- Document progress and refine the approach based on results.
