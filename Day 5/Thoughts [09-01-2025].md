# Thoughts for 9th January

## Summary
Today was primarily a day of hit and trial to improve accuracy. While there wasn’t much progress, some important realizations came to light.

## Notes
1. Tried various pretrained models but did not observe any improvement in accuracy.  
2. No CSV file or notebook was generated today as there was no significant output to save.  
3. Observed that each pretrained model has its own preprocessing function, and it’s crucial to use the respective function.

## Next Plan
- From Kaggle discussions, I realized that the training dataset contains only 40 classes, while the testing dataset contains 50 classes.  
  - This means the training dataset is incomplete, and I completely overlooked this earlier.  
- **Next Step:** Search for the missing classes on the internet, add them to the training dataset, and continue the experiments.
