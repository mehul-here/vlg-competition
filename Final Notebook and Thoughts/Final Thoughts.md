# Reflections on the Competition

The competition was an incredible journey filled with a mix of emotions. I experienced moments of frustration and sadness when challenges arose but also moments of immense happiness and joy whenever I fixed an issue or improved the model's accuracy. Those triumph moments were truly unforgettable.

## Key Learnings
Through this competition, I gained valuable knowledge and skills:
- **Kaggle:** Learned how to navigate and utilize Kaggle effectively.
- **Pretrained Models:** Understood how to implement and fine-tune pretrained models.
- **Database Handling:** Developed better strategies for managing and leveraging datasets.
- **Problem-Solving:** Enhanced my ability to tackle challenges and devise solutions.

Overall, the experience was enjoyable, to say the least.

## Unexplored Ideas
One idea I was eager to try but couldn‚Äôt due to time constraints involved a different approach to the model architecture. The idea was to use **two sub-models**:
1. **Sub-model 1:**
   - Input: Image RGB array.
   - Output: A binary array representing one-hot encoded features **without a softmax function** given in dataset provided

2. **Sub-model 2:**
   - Input: Continuous feature array given in dataset provided.
   - Output: The index of the predicted animal class.

After the learning of model this approach could have allowed us to first predict a continuous array of features and then use the second model to map these features to the animal class. Unfortunately, I couldn't implement this idea within the competition's timeframe.

## Final Thoughts
Even if i am not able to join the club  , atleast i pushed my bounderies and didn't gave up till last.
