# Thoughts of 8th Jan 

## Achievements
- Achieved my targets and improved accuracy significantly.
- The day feels productive and satisfying.

## Learnings
1. **Pretrained Model (ResNet50):**  
   - Spent some time learning about pretrained models, and it was worth the effort.  
   - Implemented ResNet50, resulting in an accuracy increase from the 20s to the 40s.

2. **Inbuilt Preprocessing Function:**  
   - Discovered the importance of using the inbuilt preprocessing function to effectively leverage pretrained models.  

3. **Addressing Underfitting:**  
   - Spent considerable time troubleshooting underfitting issues.  
   - Found that using the correct preprocessing method resolved the problem. Chatgpt really came in cluth. 

4. **Customizing Pretrained Models:**  
   - Realized that using the pretrained model without modification can be problematic since its learning data  might differ from mine.   

5. **Feature Extraction:**  
   - Using pretrained models to extract features from images is a better approach than using them as-is.

## Notes
- I’ve decided to stop adding comments during the development phase.  
- Instead, I will ensure that high-quality, meaningful comments are added directly to the final file.
- Also noticed that cv2 converts the image into brg instead of rgb so it is important to change it into rgb before preprocessing.

Feeling good about today’s progress.
