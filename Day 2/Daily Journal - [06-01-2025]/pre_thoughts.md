## Targets for Today  

### 1. Optimize Image Resizing  
- Resizing images to a good level has been challenging due to RAM limitations and it may be causing the poor performance of the model so today i will try to find cap of imagen size.

### 2. Model Testing and Submission  
- Use the testing data and submit the CSV file to Kaggle.  

### 3. Code Cleanup and Documentation  
- Add comments throughout the code to improve readability and maintainability.
