# Thoughts for 11th January

## Summary
I took a day off on 10th January to refresh my mind and restart progress with a clear perspective. Today, I focused on adding new datasets for the missing 10 classes in my model.

## Progress and Observations
1. **Identified Missing Classes:**  
   - Found the 10 missing classes in the dataset.  
   - Spent time searching for datasets to cover these classes.

2. **Datasets Found:**  
   - Found datasets for **7 out of 10 classes** on Kaggle from an existing animals-trained model, which simplified the process.  
   - Remaining classes: **Rabbit**, **Collie**, and **Moose**.  

3. **Additional Dataset Search:**  
   - Discovered a **Rabbit vs Cat** dataset on Kaggle that helped cover the rabbit class.  
   - For **Collie** and **Moose**, datasets were sourced from random websites.  

4. **Resource Management:**  
   - Uploaded the Collie and Moose datasets into the `resources` folder as they were.  
   - Note: These datasets had random, gibberish filenames since I didnâ€™t rename them initially. Notebook in this directory and the other directories till Day 8 contain the same name(as i downloaded them). 
   - Fixed this issue in the final notebook with the name used in directory Other data used. 
5. **Important point**
   - I named the input directory as "moose-and-collie", so keep that in mind.
