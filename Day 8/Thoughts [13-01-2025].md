# Thoughts for 13th January

## Summary
The final day of the competition is here! Wrapped up the work with some final checks and adjustments.

## Progress and Observations
1. **Best Pretrained Model:**  
   - After evaluating all pretrained models, **DenseNet** proved to be the best performer.

2. **Training Dataset Usage:**  
   - Decided to use the entire training dataset instead of splitting it for evaluation.  
   - This approach helped create a better-trained model, and it worked effectively.

3. **Accuracy Improvement:**  
   - Achieved a slight improvement in accuracy with the adjustments made.

4. **Overall Progress:**  
   - Nothing major happened today, but the model is now ready for submission.
